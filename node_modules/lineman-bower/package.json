  "readme": "# lineman-bower\n\nThis is a plugin to make it easy to use Bower in conjunction with a\n[Lineman](http://linemanjs.com) app.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, add the plugin to your lineman project:\n\n```\n$ npm install lineman-bower --save-dev\n```\n\nWhen you install lineman-bower, it should create a default `.bowerrc` (unless one already exists) with the following vendor directory:\n\n```\n{\n  \"directory\": \"/vendor/bower\"\n}\n```\n\nThird, you'll want to make sure that your bower dependencies don't get checked\ninto git, so add them to your `.gitignore`:\n\n```\n/vendor/bower\n```\n\nNext, you'll need a `bower.json` to start pulling down dependencies:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"jquery\": \"~1.9.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you'll want to make sure that jquery is made available when Lineman\nconcatenates your vendor JavaScript libraries. You can do this by extending the\n`js.vendor` configuration in `config/files.js` like so:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = require(process.env[\"LINEMAN_MAIN\"]).config.extend(\"files\", {\n  js: {\n    vendor: [\n      \"vendor/bower/jquery/jquery.js\",\n      \"vendor/js/**/*.js\"  //Note that this glob remains for traditional vendor libs\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNow, when you run `lineman run` and visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000),\nyou should see Bower install jQuery and have access to the library on the page.\n",
