  "readme": "# lineman-angular\n\nThis is a plugin to get started with Angular.js using\n[Lineman](http://linemanjs.com). We recommend you look at our\n[Angular template project](https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman-angular-template/)\nas a starting point.\n\n## What's this plugin do?\n\nThis plugin will configure your lineman project to incorporate:\n\n * **grunt-ngmin** to handle minification, replacing uglify, in order to deal with Angular's fucntion#toString()'ing to figure out what to inject into your methods.\n * **grunt-angular-templates** to compile the client-side `*.html` templates you add to `app/templates`\n\n## Notes\n\nKeep in mind that `grunt-angular-templates` assumes that your module is named app. You'll need to override that in your lineman project if you'd like your templates on some other module, like so:\n\n```\n ngtemplates: {\n   options: {\n     module: \"myModuleName\"\n   }\n }\n```\n",
