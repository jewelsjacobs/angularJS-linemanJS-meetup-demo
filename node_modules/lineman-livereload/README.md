# lineman-livereload

This is a plugin to make it easy to use [Livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) via `grunt-contrib-watch` in conjunction with a
[Lineman](http://linemanjs.com) app.

## Usage

First, add the plugin to your lineman project:

```
$ npm install lineman-livereload --save-dev
```

By default this configures livereload to work with .coffee, .js, .less, and .scss files.
